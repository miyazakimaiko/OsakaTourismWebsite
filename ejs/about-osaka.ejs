                <p>
                    Osaka is located on the main island of Honshu, roughly in the center of Japan. 
                    Osaka City, which was incorporated in 1889, has a population of 2.69 million 
                    and an area of 225.21 square kilometers.

                    Osaka Prefecture, which includes Osaka City (its capital) and 42 other municipalities, 
                    has a population of 8.84million and a total land mass of about 1,905 square kilometers. 
                    Although Osaka is Japan's second smallest prefecture by size, its population represents 
                    7% of the entire nation, making it the second most populous prefecture after Tokyo. 
                    Furthermore, 10% of all non-Japanese residents live in Osaka.

                <h2 class="section-title">HISTORY & CULTURE</h2>
                <p>
                    From time immemorial, Osaka has been a town bustling with traders. Merchants came in 
                    from the east and the west, gathering in Osaka to buy and sell rice. Osakans' passion
                     and discernment for food has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. After all, 
                     this is the city once called "tenka no daidokoro," "kitchen of the nation."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The importance Osakans attach to matters of dining is clear in an instant if you 
                    look around Shinsekai, Fukushima, and Tsuruhashi. Muster your courage and step forth 
                    for a culinary walking tour and you, too, can engage in the fine Osaka tradition of 
                    "kuidaore." "Kuidaore" as an expression meaning to seek out delicious food with 
                    determination, pouring money into eating until you are bankrupt (literally, 
                    "eat-yourself-broke.") This phrase originated in Osaka, so of course the flavors and 
                    tastes of Osaka have been stamped with many a seal of approval.
